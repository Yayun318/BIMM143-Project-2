BIMM143 Project 2 Code
First Draft of Project 2C uploaded

# My scientific question: 
Since the research shows that the MyD88-dependent TLR signaling pathway is most likely to be functional in terms of Mycobacterium Vaccae vaccine effect, is it possible for Mycobacterium Vaccae to have the same effect of stimulating human TLR signaling pathway?

# My hypothesis: 
If the TLR receptor of humans is structurally similar to the TLR receptor of mice, Mycobacterium Vaccae vaccine might have the same effect of stimulating TLR signaling pathway in humans.
